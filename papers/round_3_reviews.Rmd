## What's Changed

1. Bolstered the literature review
* Provided larger coverage of the short-term rental issues by extending discussion to some non-Real Estate centric work [@kakar2018visible; @cheng2018sharing]
* Added in a few very recent publications to help solidify the importance of this work [@manning2018hotel] and to provide deeper look at previous short term rental pricing work[@gibbs2018use; @gibbs2018pricing; @oskam2018s]
