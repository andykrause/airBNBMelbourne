## Intro

## Lit Review

## Method

### Scenario

You buy a property on Sept 1, 2015. In order to maximize the return over the next 12 months, should you rent long term or AirBNB?
- Does it depend on the property type or location?
- 'Market' sets LTR, you set STR.  
- We will not consider non-economic costs (time, liquidity, etc.) at this point.

### Equation

AirbnbRev = nightly rate * occupancy - (short costs + long costs)
-- short costs = cleaning, time
-- long costs = taxes and maintenance

LtRev = weekly rate * (52 - search time) - (short costs + long costs)
-- short costs = brokerage
-- long costs = taxes and maintenance

When is AirbnbRev > LtRev?

## Data

Airbnb data from AirDNA.  All of Melbourne.  Most of Oct 2014 to Aug 30th 2016.  Full data from Sept 1 2015 to Aug 30 2016.  Daily and property data.  Is scraped weekly or so for each property.  All prices in US dollars.

- Show example

Long-term data from Domain.  All of Melbourne.  June 2010 to June 2016.  Rental listings and final agreed prices. All property types.

- Show example

No direct link between data (no addresses given in AirBNB)

### Preparation

### Imputing

### Costs

-- Assume long term costs are equivalent

### Comparing

## Results

-- Start with a global analysis

### What is accurate?

- Discuss why Airbnb Actual is the only relevant one.  
-- Show charts
-- Discuss problems with Rate imputation
-- Discuss problems with Occupancy imputation

#### Comp Tables/Figs

### Heat Maps

### Submarkets

### Flexible Geo Analysis

### Logit Models (maybe?)

### Reference to Shiny App

## Future Research

- Does time of purchase (which month) matter?
